I graduated from the University of Sussex with a master's degree in robotics. My undergraduate major was Computer Science and Technology, and I graduated from Henan Normal University. 

Currently, I am conducting research on embodied intelligence at the School of AI, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My supervisor is Professor Lian Wenzhao, and I work in the HIROL laboratory. As a newcomer in the field of embodied intelligence, I am very willing to learn from my seniors. If you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me.
