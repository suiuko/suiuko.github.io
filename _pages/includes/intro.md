I am a PhD student at the University of Sussex (funded by CSC). I received my MSc in Robotics from the University of Sussex in June 2025.

Currently, I conduct research on embodied intelligence in the Robotics Laboratory at the University of Sussex, supervised by <span class="pii-mask">Professor Bao Kha Nguyen</span>. I am also a visiting doctoral student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (HIROL Lab), supervised by Professor <span class="pii-mask">Professor Lian Wenzhao</span>.

As a newcomer to embodied intelligence, I’m eager to learn from senior researchers and peers. If you’re interested in my work, please feel free to contact me.

# 🌟 Research Orientation

Embodied AI & Multimodal Foundation Models

Leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for embodied reasoning and decision-making.
